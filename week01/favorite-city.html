    <h1>Here is my favorite city!</h1>
    <h2>Pretty cool right?</h2>

    <p>This is Cebu City, I used to live here with my parents when I was little.</p>
    <p>We had to move somewhere far because we were able to find a house in a village.</p>
    <p>I still visit this city every once in a while and this image below is nearby</p>
    <p>the Cebu Philippines Temple so it's very familiar to me.</p>
    <p>This part of the city has a lot of malls and parks to visit with your family.</p>
